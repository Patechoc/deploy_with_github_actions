      # This action checks out your repository to $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so that your workflow can access the contents of your repository.
      # By default, this is equivalent to running git fetch and git checkout $GITHUB_SHA, so that you'll always have your repo contents
      # at the version that triggered the workflow. See here to learn what $GITHUB_SHA is for different kinds of events.
