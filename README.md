## What are all these GitHub, GitHub, GitHub...?

- GitHub* ... 
- [GitHub Pages*](https://help.github.com/en#github-pages-basics) ...

Recently bought by Microsoft (... 2018) ... scared about the future of GitHub, but since then, we got:

- GitHub private repositories hosted FREE-OF-CHARGE!
- and an amazing new feature: **GitHub Actions** :rocket::rocket::rocket: :confetti_ball::confetti_ball::confetti_ball: !!!

- GitHub Actions*
  - GitHub Actions is still in Beta you can sign up [here](https://github.com/features/actions/signup/).



- Free for open source projects
- hosted and maintained by GitHub (aka the giant... Microsoft!)

### The "GitHub way": a little schematic of what happens

Typically "made by GitHub", you can manage verions of files using the powerful `git` software, either:

- from the GUI (practical for newbies using `git` but also for getting used to more advanced commands)
- from a terminal and command lines (practical when using `git` within scripts, typically SHELL scripts or Dockerfiles)

### GitHub Actions

> IFFT-like experience right within GitHub


### Let's go through an Example

- build an Hellow World app, e.g. in Vue.JS
- Test your app locally
- Deploy it by writing the building steps in a recipe which you store in a config file (in `.github/workflows/my_new_CI_workflow.yml`), which can also be generated from GUI

Add screenshots of the steps !!!
